        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Builder Hall 9</h2>
        <p>Builder Hall 9 is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. It costs 3,800,000 gold to upgrade from Builder Hall 8 and takes 6 days. Your base gets a cool look with a stony beam under smokestacks and heavy marbles on pillars. <b>Builder Hall 9 Bases</b> unlock awesome defenses like the Lava Launcher, which burns troops over time, and the BOB Control building for extra support. You also get upgrades to traps like Mega Mines and troops like Hog Gliders and Night Witches. These make layouts great for stopping BH9 attacks like Drop Ship swarms, Power PEKKA rushes, or Minion hordes.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall 9 is a favorite for players who want to dominate the Builder Base leaderboard. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Lava Launcher range and Builder Base 2.0, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your BH9 village from tough attacks. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/bh09/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real BH9 attacks, like those with Hog Gliders or Battle Copters. Builder Hall 9 is all about power, and our BH9 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Strategies for Builder Hall 9 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>BH9 bases</b> need smart layouts to stop enemies in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. BH9 uses a two-stage system, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 defending against different attack waves. Here are key strategies, inspired by bases-coc.com, to build strong <b>Builder Hall 9 Bases</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Centralized Builder Hall:</b> Place the Builder Hall in the middle or a strong compartment. Surround it with heavy defenses like the Lava Launcher, Mega Tesla, and Crusher. This stops BH9 attackers from getting easy stars. For example, Base #08 on our site puts the Builder Hall in a central section with Multi-Mortar and Firecrackers nearby to punish spam attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Stage Defense:</b> Design Stage 1 with spread-out defenses to weaken BH9 armies like Drop Ships or Power PEKKAs. Use dead zones—empty spaces without buildings—to mess up troop pathing. Stage 2 should have tight compartments with OTTO’s Outpost and Roaster to finish off remaining troops. Base #15 uses spread-out Archer Towers in Stage 1 and a central Lava Launcher in Stage 2 to maximize defense. Copy these layouts at bases-coc.com/bases/bh09/.</li>
            <li><b>Trap Placement:</b> Place traps like Mega Mines, Push Traps, and Spring Traps near high-value defenses or open paths. Mega Mines blast air troops like Minions, while Push Traps redirect ground units like Hog Gliders into Crushers. Base #14 uses Mega Mines and Hidden Teslas near the Builder Hall to slow attackers. Our designs show where to place traps for BH9 attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Air and Ground Defense:</b> BH9 attacks often mix air (Drop Ships, Battle Copters) and ground (Power PEKKAs, Giants). Spread Air Bombs and Firecrackers in a triangular pattern to counter air spam, and place Giant Cannons and Multi-Mortars to stop ground rushes. Base #34 has Air Bombs and a Roaster in the central section to shred air troops, while Crushers handle ground units. Copy these at our site.</li>
            <li><b>Protect Key Buildings:</b> Guard OTTO’s Outpost and resource buildings with walls and defenses like Double Cannons and Archer Towers. Place storages outside main compartments to distract attackers from the Builder Hall. Base #13 puts resources outside walls to slow BH9 armies, with Hidden Teslas nearby for surprises. Our layouts protect your BH9 loot and trophies.</li>
            <li><b>Compartmentalized Layouts:</b> Use walls to create multiple compartments. This slows BH9 troops like Wall Breakers and forces attackers to waste time. Base #09 has boxes with Firecrackers and Cannons to trap enemies. Our site’s designs use walls to make BH9 bases tough to crack.</li>
            <li><b>Clan Castle Troops:</b> Fill the Guard Post with a mix of high-damage troops like Raged Barbarians and Sneaky Archers. They disrupt BH9 attacks like Minion swarms. Place the Guard Post near the Builder Hall or key defenses to engage enemies early. Our videos show how these troops stop BH9 raids.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our <b>BH9 bases</b> are updated daily to match the BH9 meta. They come with copy links and videos showing their strength against BH9 attacks. Copy the best <b>COC designs</b> at bases-coc.com/bases/bh09/ to make your Builder Hall 9 a beast.</p>
