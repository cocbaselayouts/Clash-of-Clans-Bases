        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 11</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 11, released by Supercell on December 10, 2015, is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans. It costs 4,000,000 gold to upgrade from Town Hall 10 and takes 3 days, 12 hours. Your village gets a fiery look with a blazing Town Hall. Town Hall 11 Bases unlock cool defenses like the Eagle Artillery, which smashes enemy troops with huge damage, and the Grand Warden, a hero who boosts your defenses with his aura. You also get level 12 walls and stronger troops like Electro Dragons. These make layouts great for stopping TH11 attacks like Queen Walks, Miner rushes, or Bowler smashes.</p>
        <p>Since its release, Town Hall 11 has been a favorite for players who want to rule wars and leaderboards. Supercell’s 2016 and 2017 updates, like tweaks to the Eagle Artillery’s range and Grand Warden’s abilities, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your TH11 village, whether you’re in Clan War Leagues or guarding loot. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/th11/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real TH11 attacks. Town Hall 11 is all about power, and our TH11 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <p>Your <b>TH11 bases</b> come in different types to fit how you play Clash of Clans at Town Hall 11. Each needs a special layout to work best against TH11’s attacks. Here are the main categories, inspired by bases-coc.com, with designs you can copy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>War/CWL Bases:</b> These are for TH11 Clan Wars and Clan War Leagues. They stop three-star attacks from armies like Queen Walk LaLo or Bowler smashes.

            <li><b>Farming Bases:</b> These save TH11’s gold, elixir, and dark elixir. Storages go deep inside, guarded by maxed Inferno Towers and X-Bows. Walls make tight compartments to stop TH11 troops like Witches. The Town Hall is often outside to trick attackers away from loot. Giant Bombs stop ground attacks. Copy farming <b>TH11 Layouts</b> from our site to keep your TH11 loot safe while upgrading.</li>
            <li><b>Hybrid Bases:</b> These protect loot and trophies for TH11 players. They guard storages and the Town Hall with defenses like Wizard Towers and Bomb Towers.

            <li><b>Anti 2 Stars Bases:</b> These stop two-star attacks in TH11 wars or trophy matches. Defenses spread out to make attackers work hard. Inferno Towers and mortars cover outer areas.

            <li><b>Anti Air/Electro Bases:</b> These crush TH11’s air attacks, like Electro Dragons and Balloons. Maxed air defenses, air sweepers, and air bombs go in key spots. Walls push ground troops into Bomb Towers. These layouts destroy TH11’s air-heavy armies like Dragon spam. Copy anti-air/electro bases from our site to beat air raids.</li>
            <li><b>Anti Trophy Bases:</b> These make trophy pushing hard for TH11 attackers. The Town Hall sits in a strong core.
