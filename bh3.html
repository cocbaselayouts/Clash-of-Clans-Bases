        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Builder Hall 3</h2>
        <p>Builder Hall 3 is a great starting point in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. It costs 100,000 gold to upgrade from Builder Hall 2 and takes 1 day. Your base gets a neat look with a smoky design and a hammer hitting iron. <b>Builder Hall 3 Bases</b> unlock cool defenses like the Firecracker, which shoots air troops, and the Crusher, which smashes ground units. You also get traps like Spring Traps and troops like Sneaky Archers and Boxer Giants. These make layouts great for stopping BH3 attacks like Barbarian swarms, Archer rushes, or Giant pushes.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall 3 is perfect for new players learning the Builder Base. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Firecracker range and Builder Base 2.0, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your BH3 village from tough attacks. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/bh03/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real BH3 attacks, like those with Sneaky Archers or Raged Barbarians. Builder Hall 3 builds your skills, and our BH3 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Strategies for Builder Hall 3 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>BH3 bases</b> need smart layouts to stop enemies in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. BH3 uses a two-stage system, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 defending against different attack waves. Here are key strategies, inspired by bases-coc.com, to build strong <b>Builder Hall 3 Bases</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Centralized Builder Hall:</b> Place the Builder Hall in the middle or a strong compartment. Surround it with key defenses like the Firecracker, Cannon, and Crusher. This stops BH3 attackers from getting easy stars. For example, Base #16 on our site puts the Builder Hall in a central spot with a Double Cannon and Archer Tower nearby to block spam attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Stage Defense:</b> Design Stage 1 with spread-out defenses to weaken BH3 armies like Boxer Giants or Sneaky Archers. Use dead zones—empty spaces with no buildings—to mess up troop pathing. Stage 2 should have tight compartments with Crusher and Firecrackers to finish off remaining troops. Base #20 uses spread-out Cannons in Stage 1 and a central Firecracker in Stage 2 to maximize defense. Copy these layouts at bases-coc.com/bases/bh03/.</li>
            <li><b>Trap Placement:</b> Place traps like Spring Traps and Mines near high-value defenses or open paths. Mines blast air troops like Beta Minions, while Spring Traps fling ground units like Raged Barbarians away. Base #01 uses Mines and Spring Traps near the Builder Hall to slow attackers. Our designs show where to place traps for BH3 attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Air and Ground Defense:</b> BH3 attacks often mix air (Beta Minions) and ground (Boxer Giants, Barbarians). Spread Firecrackers and Air Bombs to counter air spam, and place Cannons and Double Cannons to stop ground rushes. Base #16 has Firecrackers and a Hidden Tesla in the central section to shred air troops, while Crushers handle ground units. Copy these at our site.</li>
            <li><b>Protect Key Buildings:</b> Guard resource buildings with walls and defenses like Cannons and Archer Towers. Place storages outside main compartments to distract attackers from the Builder Hall. Base #20 puts resources outside walls to slow BH3 armies, with Cannons nearby for surprises. Our layouts protect your BH3 loot and trophies.</li>
            <li><b>Compartmentalized Layouts:</b> Use walls to create multiple compartments. This slows BH3 troops like Sneaky Archers and forces attackers to waste time. Base #01 has boxes with Firecrackers and Cannons to trap enemies. Our site’s designs use walls to make BH3 bases tough to crack.</li>
            <li><b>Clan Castle Troops:</b> Fill the Guard Post with high-damage troops like Raged Barbarians or Sneaky Archers. They disrupt BH3 attacks like Giant-Archer combos. Place the Guard Post near the Builder Hall or key defenses to engage enemies early. Our videos show how these troops stop BH3 raids.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our <b>BH3 bases</b> are updated daily to match the BH3 meta. They come with copy links and videos showing their strength against BH3 attacks. Copy the best <b>COC designs</b> at bases-coc.com/bases/bh03/ to make your Builder Hall 3 a winner.</p>
