        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Builder Hall 5</h2>
        <p>Builder Hall 5 is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. It costs 1,200,000 gold to upgrade from Builder Hall 4 and takes 3 days. Your base gets a cool look with a smoky design and a hammer hitting iron. <b>Builder Hail 5 Bases</b> unlock awesome defenses like the Multi-Mortar, which blasts groups of troops, and the Battle Machine, a hero that smashes enemies. You also get upgrades to traps like Spring Traps and troops like Bombers and Cannon Carts. These make layouts great for stopping BH5 attacks like Giant-Bomber combos, Barbarian swarms, or Archer rushes.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall 5 is a favorite for players who want to dominate the Builder Base leaderboard. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Multi-Mortar splash damage and Builder Base 2.0, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your BH5 village from tough attacks. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/bh05/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real BH5 attacks, like those with Bombers or Beta Minions. Builder Hall 5 is all about power, and our BH5 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Strategies for Builder Hall 5 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>BH5 bases</b> need smart layouts to stop enemies in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. BH5 uses a two-stage system, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 defending against different attack waves. Here are key strategies, inspired by bases-coc.com, to build strong <b>Builder Hall 5 Bases</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Centralized Builder Hall:</b> Place the Builder Hall in the middle or a strong compartment. Surround it with heavy defenses like the Multi-Mortar, Double Cannon, and Crusher. This stops BH5 attackers from getting easy stars. For example, Base #05 on our site puts the Builder Hall in a central section with Firecrackers and Cannons nearby to punish spam attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Stage Defense:</b> Design Stage 1 with spread-out defenses to weaken BH5 armies like Giants or Beta Minions. Use dead zones—empty spaces without buildings—to mess up troop pathing. Stage 2 should have tight compartments with Crusher and Archer Towers to finish off remaining troops. Base #12 uses spread-out Firecrackers in Stage 1 and a central Multi-Mortar in Stage 2 to maximize defense. Copy these layouts at bases-coc.com/bases/bh05/.</li>
            <li><b>Trap Placement:</b> Place traps like Spring Traps, Push Traps, and Mines near high-value defenses or open paths. Mines blast air troops like Beta Minions, while Push Traps redirect ground units like Cannon Carts into Crushers. Base #15 uses Mines and Spring Traps near the Builder Hall to slow attackers. Our designs show where to place traps for BH5 attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Air and Ground Defense:</b> BH5 attacks often mix air (Beta Minions, Baby Dragons) and ground (Giants, Bombers). Spread Air Bombs and Firecrackers to counter air spam, and place Double Cannons and Multi-Mortars to stop ground rushes. Base #12 has Air Bombs and Firecrackers in the central section to shred air troops, while Crushers handle ground units. Copy these at our site.</li>
            <li><b>Protect Key Buildings:</b> Guard resource buildings with walls and defenses like Cannons and Archer Towers. Place storages outside main compartments to distract attackers from the Builder Hall. Base #15 puts resources outside walls to slow BH5 armies, with Archer Towers nearby for surprises. Our layouts protect your BH5 loot and trophies.</li>
            <li><b>Compartmentalized Layouts:</b> Use walls to create multiple compartments. This slows BH5 troops like Wall Breakers and forces attackers to waste time. Base #05 has boxes with Firecrackers and Cannons to trap enemies. Our site’s designs use walls to make BH5 bases tough to crack.</li>
            <li><b>Clan Castle Troops:</b> Fill the Guard Post with a mix of high-damage troops like Raged Barbarians and Sneaky Archers. They disrupt BH5 attacks like Giant-Bomber combos. Place the Guard Post near the Builder Hall or key defenses to engage enemies early. Our videos show how these troops stop BH5 raids.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our <b>BH5 bases</b> are updated daily to match the BH5 meta. They come with copy links and videos showing their strength against BH5 attacks. Copy the best <b>COC designs</b> at bases-coc.com/bases/bh05/ to make your Builder Hall 5 a beast.</p>
