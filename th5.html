        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 5</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 5 is a strong step in Clash of Clans. It costs 150,000 gold to upgrade from Town Hall 4 and takes 6 hours. The Town Hall gets a tough look with gray stone walls. Townhall 5 Bases unlock awesome defenses like the Wizard Tower, which smashes enemy groups, and Air Bombs that blast Balloons. You also get level 5 walls and troops like Giants and Wizards. These make layouts great for stopping TH5 attacks like Giant-Archer combos, Barbarian swarms, or Balloon rushes.</p>
        <p>Town Hall 5 is a favorite for players who want to rule wars and leaderboards. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Wizard Tower damage, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest COC designs to protect your TH5 village, whether you’re in Clan War Leagues or guarding loot. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/th5/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real TH5 attacks. Town Hall 5 is all about smart defense, and our TH5 Bases help you stay ahead.</p>
