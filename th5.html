Town Hall 5 Bases unlock awesome defenses like the Wizard Tower, which smashes enemy groups, and Air Bombs that blast Balloons. You also get level 5 walls and troops like Giants and Wizards. These make layouts great for stopping TH5 attacks like Giant-Archer combos, Barbarian swarms, or Balloon rushes.</p>
