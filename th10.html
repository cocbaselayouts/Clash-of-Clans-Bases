        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 10</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 10, released by Supercell on January 28, 2013, is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans. It costs 4,000,000 gold to upgrade from Town Hall 9 and takes 2 days, 12 hours. Your village gets a fiery look with lava flowing around the Town Hall. Town Hall 10 Bases unlock cool defenses like Inferno Towers, which burn through enemy troops in single or multi-target modes, and X-Bows that hit both ground and air. You also get level 11 walls and stronger troops like Miners and Valkyries. These make layouts great for stopping TH10 attacks like Lavaloon, GoWiPe, or Queen Walks.</p>
        <p>Since its release, Town Hall 10 has been a favorite for players who want to rule wars and leaderboards. Supercell’s 2014 and 2015 updates, like tweaks to Inferno Tower modes, keep the meta fresh. Our site has the latest COC designs to protect your TH10 village, whether you’re in Clan War Leagues or guarding loot. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/th10/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real TH10 attacks. Town Hall 10 is all about power, and our TH10 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Categories of Town Hall 10 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your TH10 bases come in different types to fit how you play Clash of Clans at Town Hall 10. Each needs a special layout to work best against TH10’s attacks. Here are the main categories, inspired by bases-coc.com, with designs you can copy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>War/CWL Bases:</b> These are for TH10 Clan Wars and Clan War Leagues. They stop three-star attacks from armies like Lavaloon or GoWiPe. Inferno Towers and X-Bows go in the center. Level 11 walls slow enemies down. Air defenses and air bombs block TH10’s Electro Dragons. Spring traps catch Miners. Our war COC designs are tested against TH10 war attacks. Copy them at bases-coc.com/bases/th10/ to win wars.</li>
            <li><b>Farming Bases:</b> These save TH10’s gold, elixir, and dark elixir. Storages go deep inside, guarded by maxed Inferno Towers and Bomb Towers. Walls make tight compartments to stop TH10 troops like Bowlers. The Town Hall is often outside to trick attackers away from loot. Giant Bombs stop ground attacks. Copy farming TH10 Layouts from our site to keep your TH10 loot safe while upgrading.</li>
            <li><b>Hybrid Bases:</b> These protect loot and trophies for TH10 players. They guard storages and the Town Hall with defenses like Wizard Towers and X-Bows. Hidden Teslas surprise TH10’s Miners or Hog Riders. They’re good for players who want both. Our site has hybrid designs that handle TH10 raids and trophy pushes. Copy them with links.</li>
            <li><b>Anti 2 Stars Bases:</b> These stop two-star attacks in TH10 wars or trophy matches. Defenses spread out to make attackers work hard. Inferno Towers and mortars cover outer areas. Air bombs mess up TH10’s Balloon spam. Copy anti-2-star bases from bases-coc.com/bases/th10/ to keep enemies at one star.</li>
            <li><b>Anti 3 Stars Bases:</b> These block three-star attacks in TH10’s tough war scene. Compact layouts with central Inferno Towers and layered walls tire out armies like Valkyries.

            <li><b>Anti Air/Electro Bases:</b> These crush TH10’s air attacks, like Electro Dragons and Balloons. Maxed air defenses, air sweepers, and seeking air mines go in key spots. Walls push ground troops into Bomb Towers. These layouts destroy TH10’s air-heavy armies like Lavaloon. Copy anti-air/electro Townhall 10 Bases from our site to beat air raids.</li>
            <li><b>Anti Trophy Bases:</b> These make trophy pushing hard for TH10 attackers. The Town Hall sits in a strong core. Clan Castle troops like Witches mess up TH10’s Queen Walks or Bowlers. Defenses balance to counter TH10’s top strategies. Grab anti-trophy designs at bases-coc.com/bases/th10/ to hold your TH10 rank.</li>
            <li><b>Funny/Troll Bases:</b> These trick TH10 attackers for fun. They might leave the Town Hall open but hide Hidden Teslas or Giant Bombs to punish greedy raids. They catch TH10’s Valkyries off guard. Copy funny/troll bases from our site to mess with players in casual TH10 matches.</li>
            <li><b>Legend League Bases:</b> These are for TH10’s Legends League, where pros use attacks like LaLo or Miner-Hog combos. The Town Hall is in the center, guarded by maxed X-Bows and Inferno Towers. Layered defenses stop TH10’s high-skill armies. Copy legend league bases from bases-coc.com/bases/th10/ to climb TH10’s ranks.</li>
        </ul>
