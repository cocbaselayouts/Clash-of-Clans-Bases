        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 16</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 16, released by Supercell in December 2023, is a powerhouse level in Clash of Clans. Upgrading from Town Hall 15 costs 18,000,000 gold and takes 14 days, giving your village a sleek, fiery look with a level 6 Giga Inferno. <b>Town Hall 16 Bases</b> unlock killer defenses like the Ricochet Cannon, which bounces shots to hit multiple targets, and the Monolith, a single-target beast that shreds high-hitpoint troops. You also get upgraded heroes, like the Archer Queen with new equipment, and level 17 walls for stronger layouts. These make <b>TH16 Layouts</b>perfect for stopping attacks like Root Rider rushes or Super Bowler smashes.</p>
        <p>Since its launch, Town Hall 16 has been a favorite for players aiming to dominate wars and leaderboards. Supercell’s 2024 updates, like tweaks to the Giga Inferno’s damage, keep the meta shifting, so your <b>TH16 Bases </b>need to stay current. Our site offers the latest <b>COC Layouts</b> to protect your village, whether you’re in Clan War Leagues or guarding loot. Head to bases-coc.com/bases/th16/ to copy bases built by top players, with videos showing how they fend off real attacks. Town Hall 16 is all about strength, and our Bases help you stay on top.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>War Bases:</b> Designs for Clan Wars and Clan War Leagues aim to block three-star attacks.

            <li><b>Farming Bases:</b> These keep your gold, elixir, and dark elixir safe. These layouts put storages deep inside, guarded by Giga Infernos and Scattershots, with walls forming tight compartments. The Town Hall is often outside to draw attackers away from loot. Traps like Giant Bombs stop greedy troops. Copy TH16 farming Layouts from our site to save resources while upgrading your village.</li>
            <li><b>Trophy Bases:</b> These are for climbing the leaderboard. They place the Town Hall in the center, protected by Monoliths and X-Bows, with Clan Castle troops like Lava Hounds to disrupt attacks. These balance air and ground defenses to counter Super Archer or Root Rider strategies. Grab trophy designs at bases-coc.com to hit Legends League.</li>
            <li><b>Hybrid Bases:</b> These protect both loot and trophies. They guard storages and the Town Hall with balanced defenses, using traps and tesla farms to surprise attackers. These are ideal for versatile players. Our site offers TH16 hybrid designs that handle raids and trophy pushes, ready to copy with links.</li>
            <li><b>Anti-Everything Bases:</b> These are counter to all attack types, from air to ground. They use ring or diamond layouts with air sweepers to stop Balloon rushes and tesla farms to trap Root Riders. Copy anti-everything Townhall 16 Bases from bases-coc.com/bases/th16/ for a layout that’s ready for any army.</li>
