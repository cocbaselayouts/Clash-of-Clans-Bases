        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Builder Hall 4</h2>
        <p>Builder Hall 4 is a strong starting point in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. It costs 600,000 gold to upgrade from Builder Hall 3 and takes 2 days. Your base gets a neat look with a smoky design and a hammer hitting iron. <b>Builder Hall 4 Bases</b> unlock cool defenses like the Double Cannon, which hits ground troops hard, and Firecrackers, which shoot down air units. You also get better traps like Push Traps and troops like Bombers and Boxer Giants. These make layouts work great for stopping BH4 attacks like Giant-Archer combos, Barbarian swarms, or Beta Minion rushes.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall 4 is perfect for players learning to rule the Builder Base. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Double Cannon damage and Builder Base 2.0, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your BH4 village from tough attacks. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/bh04/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real BH4 attacks, like those with Bombers or Sneaky Archers. Builder Hall 4 sets you up for success, and our BH4 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Strategies for Builder Hall 4 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>BH4 bases</b> need smart layouts to stop enemies in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. BH4 uses a two-stage system, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 defending against different attack waves. Here are key strategies, inspired by bases-coc.com, to build strong <b>Builder Hall 4 Bases</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Centralized Builder Hall:</b> Place the Builder Hall in the middle or a strong compartment. Surround it with key defenses like the Double Cannon, Firecrackers, and Crusher. This stops BH4 attackers from getting easy stars. For example, Base #04 on our site puts the Builder Hall in a central section with Cannons and Archer Towers nearby to block spam attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Stage Defense:</b> Design Stage 1 with spread-out defenses to weaken BH4 armies like Boxer Giants or Beta Minions. Use dead zones—empty spaces with no buildings—to mess up troop pathing. Stage 2 should have tight compartments with Crusher and Firecrackers to trap enemies. Base #09 uses spread-out Cannons in Stage 1 and a central Double Cannon in Stage 2 to maximize defense. Copy these layouts at bases-coc.com/bases/bh04/.</li>
            <li><b>Trap Placement:</b> Place traps like Push Traps, Spring Traps, and Mines near high-value defenses or open paths. Mines blast air troops like Beta Minions, while Push Traps send ground units like Boxer Giants into Crushers. Base #11 uses Mines and Spring Traps near the Builder Hall to trap enemies. Our designs show where to place traps for BH4 attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Air and Ground Defense:</b> BH4 attacks often mix air (Beta Minions) and ground (Boxer Giants, Bombers). Spread Air Bombs and Firecrackers to counter air spam, and place Double Cannons and Cannons to stop ground rushes. Base #9 has Air Bombs and Firecrackers in the central section to trap enemies. Our site’s designs handle BH4 attacks likeSorcerer or Sneaky Archers.</li>
            <li><b>Protect Key Buildings:</b> Guard resource buildings with walls and defenses like Cannons and Archer Towers. Place storages outside to distract attackers from the Builder Hall. Base #11 puts resources outside walls to slow BH4 armies, with Archer Towers nearby for surprises. Our layouts protect your BH4 loot and trophies.</li>
            <li><b>Compartmentalized Layouts:</b> Use walls to create multiple compartments. This slows BH4 troops like Wall Breakers and forces attackers to waste time. Base #04 has boxes with Firecrackers and Cannons to trap enemies. Our site’s designs use walls to make BH4 bases tough.</li>
            <li><b>Clan Castle Troops:</b> Fill the Guard Post with a mix of high-damage troops like Raged Barbarians and Sneaky Archers. They disrupt BH4 attacks like Giant-Archer combos. Place the Guard Post near the Builder Hall or key defenses to engage enemies early. Our videos show how these troops stop BH4 raids.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our <b>BH4 bases</b> are updated daily to match the BH4 meta. They come with copy links and videos showing their strength against BH4 attacks. Copy the best <b>COC designs</b> at bases-coc.com/bases/bh04/ to make your Builder Hall 4 a winner.</p>
