        <p>Town Hall 4 is a big step in Clash of Clans. It costs 25,000 gold to upgrade from Town Hall 3 and takes 1 day. The Town Hall gets a sturdy look with a full first floor and small windows. Townhall 4 Bases unlock strong defenses like the Air Defense, which targets Balloons, and Spring Traps that fling away Giants.

These make layouts great for stopping TH4 attacks like Barbarian-Giant combos, Archer swarms, or early Balloon rushes.</p>
