        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Builder Hall 7</h2>
        <p>Builder Hall 7 is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. It costs 2,400,000 gold to upgrade from Builder Hall 6 and takes 5 days. Your base gets a cool look with a smoky design and a hammer hitting hot iron. <b>Builder Hall 7 Bases</b> unlock awesome defenses like the Giant Cannon, which smashes ground troops, and the Roaster, which burns enemies with fire blasts. You also get upgrades to traps like Mega Mines and troops like Drop Ships and Cannon Carts. These make layouts great for stopping BH7 attacks like Baby Dragon swarms, Barbarian rushes, or Giant attacks.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall 7 is a favorite for players who want to dominate the Builder Base leaderboard. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Giant Cannon damage and Builder Base 2.0, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your BH7 village from tough attacks. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/bh07/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real BH7 attacks, like those with Drop Ships or Night Witches. Builder Hall 7 is all about power, and our BH7 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Strategies for Builder Hall 7 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>BH7 bases</b> need smart layouts to stop enemies in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. BH7 uses a two-stage system, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 defending against different attack waves. Here are key strategies, inspired by bases-coc.com, to build strong <b>Builder Hall 7 Bases</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Centralized Builder Hall:</b> Place the Builder Hall in the middle or a strong compartment. Surround it with heavy defenses like the Giant Cannon, Roaster, and Multi-Mortar. This stops BH7 attackers from getting easy stars. For example, Base #07 on our site puts the Builder Hall in a central section with Firecrackers and Double Cannons nearby to punish spam attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Stage Defense:</b> Design Stage 1 with spread-out defenses to weaken BH7 armies like Giants or Baby Dragons. Use dead zones—empty spaces without buildings—to mess up troop pathing. Stage 2 should have tight compartments with OTTO’s Outpost and Crusher to finish off remaining troops. Base #13 uses spread-out Archer Towers in Stage 1 and a central Roaster in Stage 2 to maximize defense. Copy these layouts at bases-coc.com/bases/bh07/.</li>
            <li><b>Trap Placement:</b> Place traps like Mega Mines, Push Traps, and Spring Traps near high-value defenses or open paths. Mega Mines blast air troops like Drop Ships, while Push Traps redirect ground units like Cannon Carts into Crushers. Base #34 uses Mega Mines and Hidden Teslas near the Builder Hall to slow attackers. Our designs show where to place traps for BH7 attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Air and Ground Defense:</b> BH7 attacks often mix air (Baby Dragons, Minions) and ground (Giants, Barbarians). Spread Air Bombs and Firecrackers to counter air spam, and place Giant Cannons and Multi-Mortars to stop ground rushes. Base #07 has Air Bombs and a Roaster in the central section to shred air troops, while Crushers handle ground units. Copy these at our site.</li>
            <li><b>Protect Key Buildings:</b> Guard OTTO’s Outpost and resource buildings with walls and defenses like Cannons and Archer Towers. Place storages outside main compartments to distract attackers from the Builder Hall. Base #34 puts resources outside walls to slow BH7 armies, with Hidden Teslas nearby for surprises. Our layouts protect your BH7 loot and trophies.</li>
            <li><b>Compartmentalized Layouts:</b> Use walls to create multiple compartments. This slows BH7 troops like Wall Breakers and forces attackers to waste time. Base #13 has boxes with Firecrackers and Cannons to trap enemies. Our site’s designs use walls to make BH7 bases tough to crack.</li>
            <li><b>Clan Castle Troops:</b> Fill the Guard Post with a mix of high-damage troops like Raged Barbarians and Sneaky Archers. They disrupt BH7 attacks like Giant spam. Place the Guard Post near the Builder Hall or key defenses to engage enemies early. Our videos show how these troops stop BH7 raids.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our <b>BH7 bases</b> are updated daily to match the BH7 meta. They come with copy links and videos showing their strength against BH7 attacks. Copy the best <b>COC designs</b> at bases-coc.com/bases/bh07/ to make your Builder Hall 7 a beast.</p>
