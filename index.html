        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Clash of Clans</h2>
        <p>Clash of Clans is one of the most fun mobile games ever. Made by Supercell, it’s all about building a village, training troops, and battling players worldwide. You attack enemy bases to steal their gold and elixir, while defending your own to keep your resources safe. Your COC Bases are what keep your village strong. A good Clash of Clans Base stops attackers from taking your stuff, while a weak one leaves you with nothing. Our site has tons of Clash of Clans Layouts to help you win, whether you’re farming, fighting wars, or chasing trophies.</p>
        <p>The game started back in 2012 when Supercell released it for iOS, and it hit Android in 2013. It quickly became a huge hit, with millions of players building villages and forming clans. Over the years, Supercell added new Town Hall levels, troops, and features like Clan Wars in 2014 and Builder Halls in 2017. Today, Clash of Clans is still growing, with Town Hall 17 as the latest milestone. These updates bring cool stuff like new defenses and heroes, so your COC Bases need to keep up with new attack strategies. We’ve got Clash of Clans Bases for every level, so you’re always ready for battle. Visit bases-coc.com for base designs and tips to level up your game.</p>

        
        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px"> Town Halls</h2>
        <p>Your Town Hall is the heart of your Clash of Clans village. It decides what buildings, defenses, and troops you can unlock. From Town Hall 3 to the mighty Town Hall 17, each level needs a smart COC Base to match its power. We have Clash of Clans Layouts for all kinds of goals—war bases to win Clan Wars, farming bases to protect your gold and elixir, or trophy bases to climb the leaderboard.</p>
        <p>Every Town Hall level has its own challenges. At TH17, you get the Multi-Archer Tower, which can shred air and ground attacks, so your COC Layout needs to use it wisely. At TH11, the Eagle Artillery is a game-changer for defense, and your base needs to protect it. Our Clash of Clans Bases are designed to stop popular attacks like Hog Rider rushes or Dragon raids. We share tips on placing traps, building walls, and positioning heroes to make your base tough. You can copy a COC Base from our site in a snap or use our guides to build one that fits your clan’s style. No matter your Town Hall level, we’ve got the layouts to keep your village safe.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Builderhalls</h2>
        <p>Builder Halls are a cool side village in Clash of Clans with different troops, like the Raged Barbarian, and unique defenses, like the Crusher. From Builder Hall 3 to Builder Hall 10, you need a strong COC Base to guard your Builder Hall and resources. We’ve got Clash of Clans Bases for every level. Our COC Layouts are built to stop both ground and air attacks, so you can win more Versus Battles.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall fights are fast, so your Clash of Clans Layout has to be tight and clever. At higher levels, defenses like the Lava Launcher or Mega Tesla make your base super hard to crack. For example, a good BH9 COC Base spreads traps to catch sneaky Night Witches or Baby Dragons. Our site shares base designs that balance defense and resource protection, helping you climb the Builder Base ranks. Whether you’re new to Builder Halls or pushing for BH10, our Clash of Clans Bases make it easy to stay strong and keep winning.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Updates</h2>
        <p>Clash of Clans stays fun because Supercell adds new stuff all the time. Recent updates brought Town Hall 17 with awesome features like the Multi-Archer Tower and new hero gear. These changes mean you need to tweak your COC Bases to stay tough against new attack strategies. Our site keeps up with every update, offering fresh Clash of Clans Layouts to match the latest game changes. Check bases-coc.com for bases that work with the newest patches.</p>

        <p>Supercell also makes small tweaks, like boosting defenses or changing how troops work, which can affect your COC Layout. For example, a buff to X-Bows might make your TH9 base stronger, but you’ll need to adjust trap placements. Our site explains these updates in simple words, so you know exactly how to improve your Clash of Clans Bases. We also share tips on using new buildings or troops to make your village even harder to beat. Stay ahead of the game with our updated COC Bases and easy-to-follow advice.
        </p>  

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Events</h2>
        <p>Clash of Clans events keep things exciting with rewards like gems, magic items, or special decorations. Events like troop challenges, building boosts, or Clan War Leagues test your skills and your COC Bases. For war events, you need a tough Clash of Clans Layout to help your clan win. We’ve got bases ready for events, so your village stays strong while you grab rewards.</p>

        <p>Holiday events or game anniversaries often bring temporary troops or attack boosts, which change how players attack your base. For example, a Halloween event might add spooky troops that your COC Base needs to counter. Our Clash of Clans Bases are designed to handle these special attacks, keeping your resources and trophies safe. We also share event news and tips on our site, so you can plan your COC Layout and make the most of every event. Check our homepage for the latest event updates and base ideas to stay on top.</p>  

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Seasons</h2>
        <p>Clash of Clans seasons run every month, and the Gold Pass gives you cool rewards like hero skins, magic items, and extra resources. Each season has challenges that push your COC Bases to the limit, like defending against stronger attacks or farming more loot. Our Clash of Clans Layouts, like TH14 farming bases at bases-coc.com/bases/th14/, help you protect your gold and elixir so you can complete challenges and earn big.</p>

        <p>Clan Games are a big part of seasons, where your clan works together for rewards. A strong COC Base lets you focus on tasks without losing resources to enemy raids. Our Clash of Clans Bases cover every Town Hall and Builder Hall level, so you can tackle season challenges with confidence. For example, a BH8 trophy base from bases-coc.com/bases/bh8/ can help you win Versus Battles for Clan Games points. Visit our site for season tips, base designs, and ideas to max out your rewards every month.

        <p>Making your own COC Base is fun and lets you create a layout that’s perfect for you. Here’s an easy guide to get started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Choose Your Goal:</b> Decide if you want a war, farming, or trophy Clash of Clans Layout.</li>
            <li><b>Place Big Defenses:</b>For war bases, spread out stuff like Inferno Towers. For farming, guard storages. For trophies, keep the Town Hall safe.</li>
            <li><b>Build Walls:</b>Make small sections with walls to slow down enemies.</li>
            <li><b>Add Traps:</b>Put bombs, spring traps, or air mines where attackers won’t see them.</li>
            <li><b>Test Your Base:</b>Use Friendly Challenges to see where it’s weak.</li>
            <li><b>Make It Better:</b> Move buildings or walls to fix any problems.</li>        
        </ol>
        <p>Designing Clash of Clans Bases takes practice, but it’s worth it. Our site has examples to inspire you, like TH7 farming layouts or BH10 war bases at bases-coc.com. For instance, a good TH12 COC Layout might put the Giga Tesla in the center to scare off attackers. Our podcast gives simple tricks, like how to hide traps or use walls to trick enemies, so you can build unbeatable COC Bases.</p>
