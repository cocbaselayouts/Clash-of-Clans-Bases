        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 14</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 14, released by Supercell on April 12, 2021, is a beast in Clash of Clans. It costs 14,000,000 gold to upgrade from Town Hall 13 and takes 12 days. Your village gets a jungle look with a matte purple building, golden Chinese border designs, and a level 4 Giga Inferno that poisons and slows enemies. Town Hall 14 Bases bring cool defenses like Battle Builder Huts, which repair nearby buildings during attacks, and a Pet House for powerful companions like L.A.S.S.I. You also get stronger heroes, like the Barbarian King with new gear, and level 15 walls. These make layouts great for stopping TH14 attacks like Yeti smashes or Hybrid Miner-Hog raids. <b></b></p> 
        
        <p>Since its release, Town Hall 14 has been a top pick for players who want to win wars and climb leaderboards. Supercell’s 2022 and 2023 updates, like changes to the Giga Inferno’s poison and balance tweaks, keep the game fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your TH14 village, whether you’re in Clan War Leagues or saving loot. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/th14/ to copy bases made by top players.

        <p>Your <b>TH14 bases</b> come in different types to fit how you play Clash of Clans at Town Hall 14. Each needs a special layout to work best against TH14’s attacks. Here are the main categories, inspired by bases-coc.com, with designs you can copy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>War/CWL Bases:</b> These are for TH14 Clan Wars and Clan War Leagues. They aim to stop three-star attacks from armies like Hybrid Miner-Hogs or Super Wizard blimps. The Giga Inferno and Eagle Artillery sit in the center. Level 15 walls slow enemies down. Air defenses and air bombs block TH14’s Electro Dragons. Spring traps catch Hog Riders.

            <li><b>Farming Bases:</b> These save TH14’s gold, elixir, and dark elixir. Storages go deep inside, protected by maxed Scattershots and Inferno Towers. Walls make tight compartments to stop TH14 troops like Yetis. The Town Hall is often outside to trick attackers away from loot. Giant Bombs and Bomb Towers stop ground attacks. Copy farming layouts from our site to keep your TH14 loot safe while upgrading.</li>
            <li><b>Hybrid Bases:</b> These protect loot and trophies for TH14 players. They guard storages and the Town Hall with defenses like X-Bows and Battle Builder Huts. Tesla farms surprise TH14’s Super Miners or Super Archers. They’re great for players who want both. Our site has hybrid designs that handle TH14 raids and trophy pushes. Copy them with links.</li>
            <li><b>Anti 2 Stars Bases:</b> These stop two-star attacks in TH14 wars or trophy matches. Defenses spread out to make attackers work hard. Inferno Towers and mortars cover outer areas.

            <li><b>Anti 3 Stars Bases:</b> These block three-star attacks in TH14’s tough war scene. Compact layouts with a central Giga Inferno and layered level 15 walls tire out armies like Yeti smashes. Tesla farms and spring traps stop TH14’s ground rushes. Our anti-3-star COC Layouts work against TH14 war plans. Copy them at bases-coc.com/bases/th14/.</li>
            <li><b>Anti Air/Electro Bases:</b> These crush TH14’s air attacks, like Electro Dragons and Balloons. Maxed air defenses, air sweepers, and seeking air mines go in key spots. Walls push ground troops into Bomb Towers. These layouts destroy TH14’s air-heavy armies like Dragon Rider spam. Copy anti-air/electro bases from our site to beat air raids.</li>
            <li><b>Anti Trophy Bases:</b> These make trophy pushing hard for TH14 attackers. The Town Hall sits in a strong core.

Grab anti-trophy designs at bases-coc.com to hold your TH14 rank.</li>
            <li><b>Funny/Troll Bases:</b> These trick TH14 attackers for fun. They might leave the Town Hall open but hide Tesla farms or Bomb Towers to punish greedy raids.

            <li><b>Legend League Bases:</b> These are for TH14’s Legends League, where pros use attacks like Hybrid or Yeti.
