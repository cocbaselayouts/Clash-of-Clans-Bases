        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 3</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 3 is a big step in Clash of Clans. It costs 4,000 gold to upgrade from Town Hall 2 and takes 3 hours. The Town Hall gets a sturdy look with wooden reinforcements and a small flag. Town Hall 3 Bases unlock strong defenses like the Mortar, which smashes groups of enemies, and Bombs that surprise ground troops. You also get level 3 walls and troops like Archers and Giants. These make layouts great for stopping TH3 attacks like Barbarian-Archer combos, Giant rushes, or early swarm attacks.</p>
        <p>Town Hall 3 is perfect for players aiming to shine in wars and climb leaderboards. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Mortar splash damage, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to compete. Our site has the latest COC designs to protect your TH3 village, whether you're in Clan Wars or guarding loot. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/th3/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real TH3 attacks. Town Hall 3 is all about smart layouts, and our TH3 Bases keep you ahead.</p>
