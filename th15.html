        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 15</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 15, released by Supercell on October 10, 2022, is a powerhouse level in Clash of Clans. Upgrading from Town Hall 14 costs 16,000,000 gold and takes 13 days, giving your village a sleek, icy look with a level 5 Giga Inferno. <b>Town Hall 15 Bases</b> unlock killer defenses like the Spell Tower, which casts spells like invisibility or poison to disrupt enemy troops, and the Monolith, a single-target beast that shreds high-hitpoint troops. You also get upgraded heroes, like the Grand Warden with new equipment, and level 16 walls for stronger layouts. These make <b>TH15 Layouts</b> perfect for stopping attacks like Electro Titan rushes or Super Miner smashes.</p>
        <p>Since its launch, Town Hall 15 has been a favorite for players aiming to dominate wars and leaderboards. Supercell’s 2023 and 2024 updates, like tweaks to the Spell Tower’s effects, keep the meta shifting, so your <b>TH15 Bases</b> need to stay current. Our site offers the latest <b>COC Layouts</b> to protect your village, whether you’re in Clan War Leagues or guarding loot. Head to bases-coc.com/bases/th15/ to copy bases built by top players, with videos showing how they fend off real attacks.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Categories of TownHall 15 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>TH15 Bases</b> come in different types to match your Clash of Clans playstyle. Each needs a unique <b>Town Hall 15 Layout</b> to shine. Here’s a breakdown of the main categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>War Bases:</b> Designs for Clan Wars and Clan War Leagues aim to block three-star attacks. These place defenses like the Monolith and Spell Tower in the core, surrounded by level 16 walls. Our war layouts are tested and ready to copy at bases-coc.com.</li>
            <li><b>Farming Bases:</b> These keep your gold, elixir, and dark elixir safe. Storages are protected by Giga Infernos and Scattershots, and the Town Hall is often outside. Traps and compartments guard your loot.</li>
            <li><b>Trophy Bases:</b> These are for pushing trophies. Town Hall is centralized, surrounded by X-Bows, Monoliths, and Air Defenses. Balanced to counter Super Archer and Electro Titan attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Hybrid Bases:</b> Designed to defend both loot and trophies. These layouts use trap-heavy zones and strategic building placement to handle most attack types.</li>
            <li><b>Anti-Everything Bases:</b> These layouts counter all attack strategies with diamond/ring bases, air sweepers, and tesla traps. Copy anti-attack TH15 Layouts from bases-coc.com.</li>
