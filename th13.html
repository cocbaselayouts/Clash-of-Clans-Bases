        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 13</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 13, released by Supercell on December 9, 2019, is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans. It costs 9,000,000 gold to upgrade from Town Hall 12 and takes 7 days, 12 hours. Your village gets a dark, icy look with a level 5 Giga Inferno that burns enemies with multi-target damage. Town Hall 13 Bases unlock cool defenses like Scattershots, which blast multiple troops, and the Royal Champion hero, who leaps over walls to target defenses. You also get level 14 walls and upgraded troops like Yetis and Headhunters. These make layouts great for stopping TH13 attacks like Yeti smashes, Electro Dragon spam, or Queen Walks.</p>
        <p>Since its release, Town Hall 13 has been a favorite for players who want to rule wars and leaderboards. Supercell’s 2020 and 2021 updates, like tweaks to the Giga Inferno’s slowdown effect and balance changes, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your TH13 village, whether you’re in Clan War Leagues or guarding loot. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/th13/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real TH13 attacks. Town Hall 13 is all about power, and our bases keep you ahead.</p>
