        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Builder Hall 8</h2>
        <p>Builder Hall 8 is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. It costs 2,800,000 gold to upgrade from Builder Hall 7 and takes 5 days. Your base gets a cool look with a fiery design and a hammer smashing iron. <b>Builder Hall 8 Bases</b> unlock awesome defenses like the Mega Tesla, which zaps multiple enemies, and upgrades to traps like Mega Mines and Push Traps. You also get strong troops like Power P.E.K.K.A and Night Witches, plus the Battle Copter hero. These make layouts great for stopping BH8 attacks like Drop Ship-Miner combos, Baby Dragon swarms, or P.E.K.K.A rushes.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall 8 is a favorite for players who want to dominate the Builder Base leaderboard. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Mega Tesla range and Builder Base 2.0, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your BH8 village from tough attacks. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/bh08/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real BH8 attacks, like those with Battle Copters or Cannon Carts. Builder Hall 8 is all about power, and our BH8 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Strategies for Builder Hall 8 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>BH8 bases</b> need smart layouts to stop enemies in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. BH8 uses a two-stage system, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 defending against different attack waves. Here are key strategies, inspired by bases-coc.com, to build strong <b>Builder Hall 8 Bases</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Centralized Builder Hall:</b> Place the Builder Hall in the middle or a strong compartment. Surround it with heavy defenses like the Mega Tesla, Giant Cannon, and Roaster. This stops BH8 attackers from getting easy stars. For example, Base #07 on our site puts the Builder Hall in a central section with Multi-Mortar and Crushers nearby to punish spam attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Stage Defense:</b> Design Stage 1 with spread-out defenses to weaken BH8 armies like Drop Ships or Power P.E.K.K.As. Use dead zones—empty spaces without buildings—to mess up troop pathing. Stage 2 should have tight compartments with OTTO’s Outpost and Double Cannons to finish off remaining troops. Base #08 uses spread-out Firecrackers in Stage 1 and a central Roaster in Stage 2 to maximize defense. Copy these layouts at bases-coc.com/bases/bh08/.</li>
            <li><b>Trap Placement:</b> Place traps like Mega Mines, Push Traps, and Spring Traps near high-value defenses or open paths. Mega Mines blast air troops like Baby Dragons, while Push Traps redirect ground units like Cannon Carts into Crushers. Base #07 uses Mega Mines and Hidden Teslas near OTTO’s Outpost to slow attackers. Our designs show where to place traps for BH8 attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Air and Ground Defense:</b> BH8 attacks often mix air (Battle Copters, Minions) and ground (Power P.E.K.K.A, Giants). Spread Air Bombs and Firecrackers in a triangular pattern to counter air spam, and place Giant Cannons and Multi-Mortars to stop ground rushes. Base #08 has Air Bombs and a Roaster in the central section to shred air troops, while Crushers handle ground units. Copy these at our site.</li>
            <li><b>Protect Key Buildings:</b> Guard OTTO’s Outpost and resource buildings with walls and defenses like Cannons and Archer Towers. Place storages outside main compartments to distract attackers from the Builder Hall. Base #08 puts resources outside walls to slow BH8 armies, with Hidden Teslas nearby for surprises. Our layouts protect your BH8 loot and trophies.</li>
            <li><b>Compartmentalized Layouts:</b> Use walls to create multiple compartments. This slows BH8 troops like Wall Breakers and forces attackers to waste time. Base #07 has boxes with Firecrackers and Double Cannons to trap enemies. Our site’s designs use walls to make BH8 bases tough to crack.</li>
            <li><b>Clan Castle Troops:</b> Fill the Guard Post with a mix of high-damage troops like Raged Barbarians and Sneaky Archers. They disrupt BH8 attacks like Drop Ship-Miner combos. Place the Guard Post near the Builder Hall or key defenses to engage enemies early. Our videos show how these troops stop BH8 raids.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our <b>BH8 bases</b> are updated daily to match the BH8 meta. They come with copy links and videos showing their strength against BH8 attacks. Copy the best <b>COC designs</b> at bases-coc.com/bases/bh08/ to make your Builder Hall 8 a beast.</p>
