        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Builder Hall 6</h2>
        <p>Builder Hall 6 is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. It costs 1,800,000 gold to upgrade from Builder Hall 5 and takes 4 days. Your base gets a cool look with a smoky design and a hammer hitting iron. <b>Builder Hall 6 Bases</b> unlock awesome defenses like the Roaster, which blasts troops with fire, and upgrades to traps like Push Traps and Spring Traps. You also get strong troops like Night Witches and Baby Dragons, plus the Battle Machine hero. These make layouts great for stopping BH6 attacks like Giant-Bomber combos, Baby Dragon swarms, or Barbarian rushes.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall 6 is a favorite for players who want to dominate the Builder Base leaderboard. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to Roaster damage and Builder Base 2.0, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your BH6 village from tough attacks. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/bh06/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real BH6 attacks, like those with Night Witches or Cannon Carts. Builder Hall 6 is all about power, and our BH6 Bases keep you ahead.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Strategies for Builder Hall 6 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>BH6 bases</b> need smart layouts to stop enemies in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. BH6 uses a two-stage system, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 defending against different attack waves. Here are key strategies, inspired by bases-coc.com, to build strong <b>Builder Hall 6 Bases</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Centralized Builder Hall:</b> Place the Builder Hall in the middle or a strong compartment. Surround it with heavy defenses like the Roaster, Crusher, and Multi-Mortar. This stops BH6 attackers from getting easy stars. For example, Base #06 on our site puts the Builder Hall in a central section with Firecrackers and Double Cannons nearby to punish spam attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Stage Defense:</b> Design Stage 1 with spread-out defenses to weaken BH6 armies like Giants or Baby Dragons. Use dead zones—empty spaces without buildings—to mess up troop pathing. Stage 2 should have tight compartments with Crusher and Archer Towers to finish off remaining troops. Base #16 uses spread-out Firecrackers in Stage 1 and a central Roaster in Stage 2 to maximize defense. Copy these layouts at bases-coc.com/bases/bh06/.</li>
            <li><b>Trap Placement:</b> Place traps like Push Traps, Spring Traps, and Mines near high-value defenses or open paths. Mines blast air troops like Baby Dragons, while Push Traps redirect ground units like Cannon Carts into Crushers. Base #06 uses Mines and Spring Traps near the Builder Hall to slow attackers. Our designs show where to place traps for BH6 attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Air and Ground Defense:</b> BH6 attacks often mix air (Baby Dragons, Minions) and ground (Giants, Bombers). Spread Air Bombs and Firecrackers to counter air spam, and place Double Cannons and Multi-Mortars to stop ground rushes. Base #16 has Air Bombs and a Roaster in the central section to shred air troops, while Crushers handle ground units. Copy these at our site.</li>
            <li><b>Protect Key Buildings:</b> Guard resource buildings with walls and defenses like Cannons and Archer Towers. Place storages outside main compartments to distract attackers from the Builder Hall. Base #16 puts resources outside walls to slow BH6 armies, with Archer Towers nearby for surprises. Our layouts protect your BH6 loot and trophies.</li>
            <li><b>Compartmentalized Layouts:</b> Use walls to create multiple compartments. This slows BH6 troops like Wall Breakers and forces attackers to waste time. Base #06 has boxes with Firecrackers and Cannons to trap enemies. Our site’s designs use walls to make BH6 bases tough to crack.</li>
            <li><b>Clan Castle Troops:</b> Fill the Guard Post with a mix of high-damage troops like Raged Barbarians and Sneaky Archers. They disrupt BH6 attacks like Giant-Bomber combos. Place the Guard Post near the Builder Hall or key defenses to engage enemies early. Our videos show how these troops stop BH6 raids.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our <b>BH6 bases</b> are updated daily to match the BH6 meta. They come with copy links and videos showing their strength against BH6 attacks. Copy the best <b>COC designs</b> at bases-coc.com/bases/bh06/ to make your Builder Hall 6 a beast.</p>
