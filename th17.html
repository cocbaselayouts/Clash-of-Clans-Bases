        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 17</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 17, launched by Supercell on November 25, 2024, is the most powerful level in Clash of Clans. It costs 20,000,000 gold and takes 15 days to upgrade from Town Hall 16, merging with a level 7 Eagle Artillery for a fierce look. Town Hall 17 unlocked new defenses like the Firespitter, which burns through troops, and the Giga Bomb, a trap that wipes out enemy waves. You also get the Inferno Artillery, a long-range defense that crushes ground attacks, and level 18 walls with high hit points for complex layouts. Heroes like the Archer Queen and Barbarian King gain new equipment, making them tougher in battle.</p>
        <p>Since its release, Town Hall 17 has shaken up the game, with players rushing to build TH17 Bases that handle the new meta. Supercell’s updates, adding the Merged Gear Tower, keep the meta evolving, so your Town Hall 17 needs to adapt. Our site offers the latest <b>COC Layouts</b> to protect your village, whether you’re in wars or pushing trophies. Visit bases-coc.com/bases/th17/ to copy bases designed by experienced players, complete with videos showing how they hold up against real attacks.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Categories of Town Hall 17 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>TH17 Bases</b> come in different styles to match your Clash of Clans goals. Each type needs a unique Town Hall 17 Layout to perform at its best. Here’s a rundown of the main categories, inspired by bases-coc.com, with designs you can copy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>War Bases:</b> These are for Clan Wars and Clan War Leagues are built to prevent three-star attacks. These place key defenses like the Eagle Artillery, Inferno Artillery, and Firespitter in the core, surrounded by level 18 walls to slow enemies. Air defenses and seeking air mines are central to stop Minion Prince or cloned Balloon attacks, while tornado traps counter air spam. Our war <b>Layouts</b> are tested to hold strong, with links at bases-coc.com/bases/th17/ to copy bases that win wars.</li>
            <li><b>Farming Bases:</b> These types of layouts keep your gold, elixir, and dark elixir safe. These layouts put storages deep inside, guarded by Firespitters and X-Bows, with walls creating tight compartments. The Town Hall is often outside to lure attackers away from loot. Traps like Giga Bombs punish greedy troops. Copy <b>TH17 farming Layouts</b> from our site to protect your resources while you upgrade your village.</li>
            <li><b>Trophy Bases:</b> These are for players pushing the leaderboard. They place the Town Hall in the center, protected by Inferno Artillery and Multi-Archer Towers, with Clan Castle troops like Ice Golems to disrupt attacks. These are balanced air and ground defenses to stop strategies like Super Archer or Furnace troop rushes. Grab trophy <b>Layouts</b> at bases-coc.com to climb higher in Legends League.</li>
            <li><b>Hybrid Bases:</b> These are to protect both resources and trophies. They guard storages and the Town Hall with balanced defenses, using traps and tesla farms to surprise attackers. These layouts are great for players who want versatility. Our site offers hybrid layouts that handle both loot raids and trophy attacks, available to copy with links.</li>
            <li><b>Anti-Everything Bases:</b> These are designed to counter all attack types, from air to ground. They use diamond or ring layouts with air sweepers and poison towers to stop Minion Prince or Furnace attacks, and tesla farms to trap ground troops. Copy anti-everything bases from bases-coc.com/bases/th17/ for a base that’s ready for anything.</li>
        </ul>
