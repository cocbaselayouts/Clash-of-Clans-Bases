        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Builder Hall 10</h2>
        <p>Builder Hall 10 is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. It costs 4,800,000 gold to upgrade from Builder Hall 9 and takes 7 days. Your base gets a cool look with a vibrating smokestack and a hammer hitting hot iron. <b>Builder Hall 10 Bases</b> unlock awesome defenses like the X-Bow, which blasts both air and ground troops, and upgrades to traps like Mega Mines and Push Traps. You also get maxed buildings like the Multi-Mortar, Lava Launcher, and OTTO’s Outpost, plus strong troops like PEKKAs and Cannon Carts. These make layouts great for stopping BH10 attacks like Baby Dragon spam, Pekka rushes, or Hog Glider swarms.</p>
        <p>Builder Hall 10 is a favorite for players who want to dominate the Builder Base leaderboard. Supercell’s updates, like tweaks to X-Bow damage and Builder Base 2.0, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your BH10 village from tough attacks. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/bh10/ to copy bases made by top players. Videos show how they stop real BH10 attacks, like those with Night Witches or Cannon Carts. Builder Hall 10 is all about power.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">Strategies for Builder Hall 10 Bases</h2>
        <p>Your <b>BH10 bases</b> need smart layouts to stop enemies in Clash of Clans’ Builder Base. Unlike Town Hall bases, BH10 uses a two-stage system, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 defending against different attack waves. Here are key strategies, inspired by bases-coc.com, to build strong <b>Builder Hall 10 Bases</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Centralized Builder Hall:</b> Place the Builder Hall in the middle or a strong compartment. Surround it with heavy defenses like the X-Bow, Mega Tesla, and Crusher. This stops BH10 attackers from getting easy stars. For example, Base #10 on our site puts the Builder Hall in a central section with Firecrackers and Double Cannons nearby to punish spam attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Stage Defense:</b> Design Stage 1 with spread-out defenses to weaken BH10 armies like PEKKAs or Baby Dragons. Use dead zones—empty spaces without buildings—to mess up troop pathing. Stage 2 should have tight compartments with OTTO’s Outpost and Lava Launcher to finish off remaining troops. Base #24 uses three compartments in Stage 1 and a central OTTO’s Outpost in Stage 2 to maximize defense. Copy these layouts at bases-coc.com/bases/bh10/.</li>
            <li><b>Trap Placement:</b> Place traps like Mega Mines, Push Traps, and Spring Traps near high-value defenses or open paths. Mega Mines blast air troops like Night Witches, while Push Traps redirect ground units like Cannon Carts into Crushers. Base #17 uses Mines and Hidden Teslas near OTTO’s Outpost to slow attackers. Our designs show where to place traps for BH10 attacks.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Air and Ground Defense:</b> BH10 attacks often mix air (Baby Dragons, Hog Gliders) and ground (PEKKAs, Giants). Spread Air Defenses and Air Bombs to counter air spam, and place Multi-Mortars and Giant Cannons to stop ground rushes. Base #36 has Air Bombs and a Roaster in the central section to shred air troops, while Crushers handle ground units. Copy these at our site.</li>
            <li><b>Protect Key Buildings:</b> Guard OTTO’s Outpost and resource buildings with walls and defenses like Firecrackers and Archer Towers. Place storages outside main compartments to distract attackers from the Builder Hall. Base #16 puts resources outside walls to slow BH10 armies, with Hidden Teslas nearby for surprises. Our layouts protect your BH10 loot and trophies.</li>
            <li><b>Compartmentalized Layouts:</b> Use walls to create multiple compartments. This slows BH10 troops like Wall Breakers and forces attackers to waste time. Base #24 has boxes with Roasters and Giant Cannons to trap enemies. Our site’s designs use walls to make BH10 bases tough to crack.</li>
            <li><b>Clan Castle Troops:</b> Fill the Guard Post with a mix of high-damage troops like Raged Barbarians and Sneaky Archers. They disrupt BH10 attacks like Pekka spam. Place the Guard Post near the Builder Hall or key defenses to engage enemies early. Our videos show how these troops stop BH10 raids.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our <b>BH10 bases</b> are updated daily to match the BH10 meta. They come with copy links and videos showing their strength against BH10 attacks. Copy the best <b>COC designs</b> at bases-coc.com/bases/bh10/ to make your Builder Hall 10 a beast.</p>
