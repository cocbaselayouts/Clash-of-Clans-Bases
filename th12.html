        <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; background-color: purple; color: white; padding: 10px">About Town Hall 12</h2>
        <p>Town Hall 12, released by Supercell on June 11, 2018, is a powerhouse in Clash of Clans. It costs 8,000,000 gold to upgrade from Town Hall 11 and takes 8 days. Your village gets a striking blue and electric look with a Giga Tesla hidden inside the Town Hall, delivering multi-target shock damage. Town Hall 12 Bases unlock powerful defenses like the Siege Workshop for Siege Machines and upgraded defenses like the Eagle Artillery and Inferno Towers. You also get access to maxed heroes, including the Barbarian King and Archer Queen, and level 50 walls with segments upgradable to level 13. These defenses make layouts ideal for stopping TH12 attacks like Electro Dragon spam, Yeti smashes, or Queen Walks with Miners.</p>
        <p>Since its release, Town Hall 12 has been a top pick for players who want to rule wars and leaderboards. Supercell’s 2019 and 2020 updates, like tweaks to the Giga Tesla’s damage, keep the meta fresh. Your bases need to stay new to keep up. Our site has the latest <b>COC designs</b> to protect your TH12 village, whether you’re in Clan War Leagues or guarding loot. Go to bases-coc.com/bases/th12/ to copy bases made by top players.
